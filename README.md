# Keanu TTS
Keanu TTS is a simple project that I made when I was bored. Essentially, I had to download a dictionary of English words corresponding to the sounds they're made of. After that, I cropped audio of Keanu Reeves' interviews to collect all the sounds in the dictionary. 
Based on that, I wrote code that compiles sounds together when inputted a word or a sentence. 
Ultimately, I created a Flask app and deployed it in Heroku so everyone can play with it.
